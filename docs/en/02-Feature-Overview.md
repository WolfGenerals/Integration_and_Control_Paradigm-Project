## Design Philosophy

**Physics isn't just visual — it's playable.**

Most mods:
- Animate suspension compression → Our springs *actually compress* (code has spring constants)
- Show "50 km/h" on HUD → That's `linearVelocity.length() × 3.6` we computed
- Play "wheel flew off" particles → In future, the wheel *physically* flies off

**Components matter more than the whole.**

Each block is an independent component. Vehicle performance depends on component arrangement, not just data values.
